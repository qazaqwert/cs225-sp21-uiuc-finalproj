# CS 225 Team Contract (jjoshi8-markb5-jtentis2)

### Communication

1. **Team Meetings:** Our team will meet Thursdays from 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm (and optionally weekends if they work better) in-person at Nugent Hall. Any notes or ideas will be saved in a Google document that is edited by everyone during the meeting. The weekly update will also be pushed to Github at this meeting.
2. **Assistance:** Each team member can be contacted through email ({jjoshi8, markb5, jtentis2}@illinois.edu), Discord, or text message. Barring any emergency situation, we commit to responding to messages within 24 hours.
3. **Respect:** All ideas will be run by all group members. If a consensus cannot be reached, we will decide how to move forward by a majority count. Even if a group member does not necessarily agree with the agreed-upon decision, they should move forward and not let it affect their commitment to the project. 

### Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution:** Each week we will split up the deliverables based on preference and the corresponding workload of the deliverable. If there is an issue, we will let a random number generator decide who will be doing what. We also may distribute the work differently on a week-by-week basis depending on the weekly course workload of each individual member.
2. **Time Commitment:** Each member should plan to spend around 3-5 hours each week working on the project. However, if more time is needed to accomplish a task, a member may need to spend more time on their task. With that being said, other group members should assist if at all possible.
3. **Conflict Resolution:** All conflicts will be decided by rolling a six-sided die, where 1 or 2 correspond to jjoshi8, 3 or 4 correspond to markb5, and 5 or 6 correspond to jtentis2.
